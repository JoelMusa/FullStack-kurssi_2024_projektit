# FullStack-Project2

This API is done by using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
The application can do the four basic CRUD operations.
I used Postman to test the API.

### This application runs in Render, you can try it out: https://fullstack-kurssi-2024-projekti2.onrender.com
Note: This app might not work fully, because MongoDB shuts down connection due to inactivity.
