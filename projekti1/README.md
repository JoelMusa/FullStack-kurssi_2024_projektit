# FullStack-Projekti1

This server is done by using Node.js and Express frameworks.
The application downloads static html files to the server.
I used Bootstrap 5 for styling, and jQuery for making JavaScript code more simple sometimes.

### This application runs in Render, you can try it out: https://fullstack-kurssi-2024-projektit.onrender.com
